This demo project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using the Flask framework.
This project demonstrates the basic operations of a CRUD application and serves as a starting point for building more complex applications using this

Prerequisites to smoothly run this project:

Python 3.x, Flask ( Flask-MySQLdb, Flask-Mail, Flask-WTF), MySQL 

Features:

Create new user (Registration)

Read existing user (Retrieving basic details for account on succeful login)

Update existing user (Registration verification using email smtp)

Delete existing user (Delete user on email otp verification )

Shortcomings:

As mentioned, this is not a full fledged flask standalone website. Instead just a functioning demo. You can very easily build over this project.
